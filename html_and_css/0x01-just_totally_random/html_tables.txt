Tables in html use caption to describe them. caption should be the first child of the table element.

tr element is used to indicate a table row. The td element indicates a data cell, while the th element indicates a header cell.

"border: collapse" property allow cell borders to collapse into a single border, instead of a border around each cell. 
Also set the border property to 0 to hide the borders themselves
